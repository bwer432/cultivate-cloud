## Bootstrap

The demonstrations described in this site and 
demo artifacts included in the `awsdemo` (*singular*) repository
set up resources using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

Prior to using `cdk` in the demonstrations, you need to "bootstrap"
your AWS account on a per-region basis. 
Follow this video or the steps listed in this topic.
