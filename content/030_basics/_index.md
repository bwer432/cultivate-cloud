## Basics

Many of the demonstrations scripted in the  [`awsdemo` repo](https://github.com/bwer432/awsdemo) follow this theme:

1. ***Deploy*** a stack of AWS resources.
2. Use those resources in some way(s).
3. ***Destroy*** those resources.

As the Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is used for the *deploy* and *destroy* tasks in such an endeavor, it would be appropriate to be familiar with deploying resources using the CDK.

The purpose of this "Basics" section is to help you become more familiar and hopefully more comfortable with some fundamentals of the CDK. Please work through the following:

- [AWS CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com)
- Deploy an empty stack
- Deploy an Amazon SQS queue
- Tag resources
